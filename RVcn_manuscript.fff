The scale in all plots has been transformed by taking the cube root of the true values, which preserves the overall shape of the distribution but compresses the scale towards 1. \textbf{(A)} Distribution of citation counts. \textbf{(B)} Distribution of average citations per year. \textbf{(C)} Distribution of sample size. The x-axis limit is set to 8000, which excludes less than 1 percent of data points. \textbf{(D)} Distribution of \textit{RV\textsubscript{Cn}} replication value estimates.}\label{fig:7}
